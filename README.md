## Bienvenido

My name is Sebastian Martinez, one day I got stuck with sebastinez.

I'm a mechanical engineer who works currently at [NUCLEARIS](https://nuclearis.com), where I have the pleasure to develop and maintain a variety of software projects, besides my normal activity. Mostly decentralized PoC and MVPs.

Besides work, I do also like to build webpages for friends, family and the eventually company project.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sebastinez87).
